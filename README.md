This **README** is meant to explain `how the app works` and what was done during the `TP`.

# **What we did**
We used Deta to create a simple app in python (using https://deta.space/docs/en/build/quick-starts/python). We used github to create versions, manage our project. We used google analytics to keep an eye on who’s watching our webpage using a tag in the python app.

# **How to run the app**
The app is running on https://tp1deta-1-j1522544.deta.app. It's a simple app that displays a message, there is a tag in the code that allows us to see who's watchin using google analytics. The code is in the github repository.
The app is coded in python, deta is used to host the app and it is linked to github to allow us to update the app easily.
